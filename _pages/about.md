Hi there!

I am Esteban Carisimo, a Postdoctoral Researcher at [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu), a group in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu). My research focuses on Internet topology and infrastructure, with an emphasis on the role of governments in connectivity and content delivery. I am particularly interested in Submarine Cable Networks (SCNs), Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), transit diversity, and network congestion. My work aims to enrich the public debate on digital connectivity with evidence-based insights. Being born in Latin America influences my research, particularly regarding the Internet's evolution in the region. I earned my Doctoral (2020) and Engineering (2014) degrees from [Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/#/), where I was an Adjunct Professor in the Computer Science Department of the [School of Engineering](https://www.fi.uba.ar) from 2020 to 2021.
