Hi there!

I am **Esteban Carisimo**, a **Network Protocols Engineer at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)**. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu), a research group in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu).

My work focuses on Internet topology and infrastructure. I have studied multiple aspects of Internet infrastructures, with particular interest in Submarine Cable Networks (SCNs), Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). During my academic career, I also paid close attention to the role of governments in network shaping and public-sector content delivery. My goal is to contribute to building a more resilient, open, and equitable Internet, and to enrich the public debate on digital connectivity with evidence-based insights.

Being born in Latin America strongly influences my research interests, especially regarding the Internet’s evolution in the region. I earned my Doctoral degree (2020) and Engineering degree (2014) from the [Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/#/), where I also served as an Assistant Professor (Profesor Regular Adjunto) in the Computer Science Department of the [School of Engineering](https://www.fi.uba.ar) from 2020 to 2021.
