    abstract="We present the first empirical study of subnational hosting strategies, using Argentina's 24 provinces as a case. Starting from oﬃcial landing pages, we analyze $\approx$1.2k domains (collected Oct 2023 – Apr 2024), classifying serving networks by operational control (sovereign, domestic third-party, global) and examining authoritative DNS and HTTPS deployment. We relate these choices to 31 demographic, economic, technological, and political covariates – associations only, not causal claims. We find substantial heterogeneity: some provinces operate sovereign infrastructure; others rely on domestic incumbents or outsource to global providers. Federal capacity is rarely used, with provinces favoring bespoke or repurposed networks (including utility backbones). Legacy telecom footprints remain strong predictors of hosting choice even within a shared national umbrella. We also observe frequent splits between hosting and nameservers and uneven HTTPS hygiene. Taken together, the study oﬀers a reusable measurement template and benchmarks that make sovereigntyperformance trade-oﬀs measurable below the nation level."

Borges overcomes these limitations by combining traditional sources with few-shot LLM prompting to extract sibling relationships from free-text fields in PeeringDB, and by introducing website-based inference using redirect chains, domain similarity, and favicon analysis. Our evaluation shows that Borges outperforms prior methods, achieving a 7\% improvement in sibling ASN identification and an Organization Factor score of 0.3576. It also expands the recognized user base of large Internet conglomerates by 192 million users (approx. 5\% of the global Internet population) and improves geographic footprint estimates across multiple regions.",

    abstract="Network Telescopes, often referred to as darknets, capture unsolicited traffic directed toward advertised but unused IP spaces, enabling researchers and operators to monitor malicious, Internet-wide network phenomena such as vulnerability scanning, botnet propagation, and DoS backscatter. Detecting these events, however, has become increasingly challenging due to the growing traffic volumes that telescopes receive. To address this, we introduce DarkSim, a novel analytic framework that utilizes Dynamic Time Warping to measure similarities within the high-dimensional time series of network traffic. DarkSim combines traditional raw packet processing with statistical approaches, identifying traffic anomalies and enabling rapid time-to-insight. We evaluate our framework against DarkGLASSO, an existing method based on the Graphical LASSO algorithm, using data from the UCSD Network Telescope. Based on our manually classified detections, DarkSim showcased perfect precision and an overlap of up to 91% of DarkGLASSO's detections in contrast to DarkGLASSO's maximum of 73.3\% precision and detection overlap of 37.5\% with the former. We further demon- strate DarkSim’s capability to detect two real-world events in our case studies: (1) an increase in scanning activities surrounding CVE public disclosures, and (2) shifts in country- and network-level scanning patterns that indicate aggressive scanning. DarkSim provides a detailed and interpretable analysis framework for time-series anomalies, representing a new contribution to network security analytics.",

Draw ing from data collected across 61 countries spanning every continent and region, capturing over 82% of the world's Internet population, we examine the preferred hosting models for public-facing government sites and associated resources. Leveraging this dataset, we analyze government hosting strategies, cross-border dependencies, and the level of centralization in government web services. Among other findings, we show that governments predominantly rely on third-party infrastructure for data delivery, although this varies significantly, with even neighboring countries showing con- trasting patterns. Despite a preference for third-party hosting solutions, most government URLs in our study are served from domestic servers, although again with significant regional variation. Looking at overseas located servers, while the majority are found in North America and Western Europe, we note some interesting bilateral relationships (e.g., with 79% of Mexico’s government URLs being served from the US, and 26\% of China's government URLs from Japan). This research contributes to understanding the evolving landscape of serving infrastructures in the government sector, and the choices governments make between leveraging third-party solutions and maintaining control over users' access to their services and information.",

Most research on this topic has focused on the application level, studying how content is manipulated or removed on websites, blogs or social media. However, in order for governments to obtain and maintain control of digital data flows, they need to secure access to the network infrastructure at the level of Internet service providers. In this paper, we study how the network topology of the Internet varies across different political environments, distinguishing between control at the level of individual Internet users (access) and at a higher level in the hierarchy of network carriers (transit). Using a novel method to estimate the structure of the Internet from network measurements, we show that in autocratic countries, state-owned (rather than privately-owned) providers have a markedly higher degree of control over transit networks. We also show that state-owned Internet providers often provide Internet access abroad, with a clear focus on other autocratic countries. Together, these results suggest that in autocracies, the network infrastructure is organized in a way that is more susceptible to the monitoring and manipulation of Internet data flows by state-owned providers both domestically and abroad.}",

We then merge manually curated datasets on known government-ordered shutdowns and large-scale Internet outages, further augmenting them with data on real-world events, macroeconomic and sociopolitical indicators, and network operator statistics. Our analysis confirms previous findings on the economic and political profiles of countries with government-ordered shutdowns. Extending this analysis, we find that countries with national-scale spontaneous outages often have profiles similar to countries with shutdowns, differing from countries that experience neither. However, we find that government-ordered shutdowns are many more times likely to occur on days of mobilization, coinciding with elections, protests, and coups. Our study also characterizes the temporal characteristics of Internet shutdowns and finds that they differ significantly in terms of duration, recurrence interval, and start times when compared to spontaneous outages},

In this paper, we focus on an important aspect of the evolving logical connectivity of the Internet that has received little attention to date: intercontinental long-haul links. We develop a methodology and associated processing system for identifying long haul links in traceroute measurements.

We leverage these concepts to create a jitter-based congestion inference framework that we call Jitterbug. We apply Jitterbug’s capabilities to a wide range of traffic scenarios and discover that Jitterbug can correctly identify both recurrent and one-off congestion events. We validate Jitterbug inferences against state-of-the- art autocorrelation-based inferences of recurrent congestion. We find that the two approaches have strong congruity in their inferences, but Jitter- bug holds promise for detecting one-off as well as recurrent congestion. We identify several future directions for this research including lever- aging ML/AI techniques to optimize performance and accuracy of this approach in operational settings.",

We identify nations where traffic towards a large portion of the country is serviced by a small number of Autonomous Systems, and, therefore, may be exposed to observation or selective tampering by these ASes. We introduce the Country-level Transit Influence (CTI) metric to quantify the significance of a given AS on the international transit service of a particular country. By studying the CTI values for the top ASes in each country, we find that 34 nations have transit ecosystems that render them particularly exposed, where a single AS is privy to traffic destined to over 40% of their IP addresses. In the nations where we are able to validate our findings with in-country operators, our top- five ASes are 90% accurate on average. In the countries we examine, CTI reveals two classes of networks frequently play a particularly prominent role: submarine cable operators and state-owned ASes.",

We obtain the first data set of this type, make it available to the research community together with the several lessons we learned in the process, and perform a preliminary analysis based on our data. We find that 53\% (i.e., 123) of the world's countries are majority owners of Internet operators, highlighting that this is a widespread phenomenon.

abstract = {Mapping projects usually get information from several routing data collectors or vantage points. The accuracy of maps relies on the amount and location of these collectors, which are usually located near the backbone or at large developed regions, such as ARIN's or RIPE NCC's. The lack of vantage points in Latin America makes these maps not really show the current actual status of the network in this region. For this reason, in this work we have added data from some local sources and measured how much information was missing without them.},
