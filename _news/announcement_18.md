Thrilled to announce that The Aleph, our paper on using LLMs to geolocate IP addresses through embedded hints in PTR records, has been accepted at [ACM CoNEXT 2025](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2025/#!/home). While the event is still a few months away (December), we are pleased to share our work in advance. You can read the paper: [here!](/assets/pdf/papers/2025-the-aleph.pdf)
