I've developed a toolkit utilizing [CAIDA's PyBGPStream library](https://github.com/CAIDA/pybgpstream) for in-depth analysis and anomaly detection within the BGP announcements. The project is available on GitHub and can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/estcarisimo/BGP-Collector-Analysis-Toolkit/tree/main).
